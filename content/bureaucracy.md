# ðŸ“œ Code of Conduct

The following rules will apply to all club-related activities, including all communications on this Discord server, club in-person and virtual meetings, and other events organized by the Software Engineering Club. These guidelines must be followed by both officers and members of DEV at all times.

1. Abide by the OSU's Code of Student Conduct (https://studentconduct.osu.edu/for-students/understanding-the-student-conduct-process/code-of-student-conduct-versions)

2. Be respectful
This means no mean, rude, or harassing comments. Treat others the way you want to be treated.

3. No facilitation of academic misconduct
Nobody likes to deal with COAM and neither do we.

4. No inappropriate language
Use of profanity should be kept to a reasonable minimum. Any sexism, racism, homo/transphobia, or derogatory language towards any user is prohibited.

5. No spamming online
Do not send a lot of small messages right after each other. These disrupt chat and make it hard to scroll through the server.

6. No NSFW material
Please don't make me explain this rule.

7. Do not impersonate anyone online
This includes nicknames and profile pictures. If your discord identity intentionally refers to a different individual, specify the fact of intentional reference explicitly in the bio.
