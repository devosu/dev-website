# 👀 About

DEV at OSU is a student organization that aims to provide students with the
opportunity to expand their skills in web development and other branches of
software engineering through workshops.

We are also committed to supporting your personal software projects by providing
mentorship and computing resources (free hosting and subdomains on osu.dev).

This club is welcoming everyone regardless of their experience, major, or grade.
To use perks like subdomains and cloud credits, you need to be an active OSU
student, but you can still attend workshops and recieve mentorship if you are not.
